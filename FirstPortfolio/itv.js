Positive trait/quality:
- Can't sit still. If you're looking for someone who's always working on something, count on me. Big reason why I left my othre job
is bc I felt I've learned nearly everything there was to offer. I'm now looking for new challenges, new skills to obtain, and new 
overall experience and environment.

Negative trait/quality:
- Ability to sell myself (convince people why they should use my products/creation, because i truly believe in the quality of my work).
I got the work ethics and enthusiasm for it, I just need the extra boost in personality. Then, I think I'll be set
to be very successful in everything I do.
